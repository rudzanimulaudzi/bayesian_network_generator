# Bayesian Network Generator

**Bayesian Network Generator Package** is a Python library for building, analyzing, and visualizing Bayesian Networks. It leverages libraries like `pgmpy`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to help create estimate Bayesian network structures, parameters, construct Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs), and create visualizations for your Bayesian Network models.

## Features

- **Parameter Estimation**: Learn optimal Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) using neural networks.
- **CPT Construction**: Build Conditional Probability Tables using model weights.
- **Visualization**: Generate network graphs and visualizations of CPDs.
- **Utilities**: Includes helper functions to streamline Bayesian Network workflows.
